# Medication Disposal Services at Cornwell's Chemists

## Overview
Proper disposal of unused, unwanted, or expired medications is essential for environmental protection and public safety. Cornwell's Chemists provides a free medication take-back service at all 10 branches, ensuring that medications are disposed of safely and responsibly, preventing environmental contamination and reducing the risk of accidental poisoning or misuse.

## Why Proper Medication Disposal Is Important

### Environmental Protection
- Medications disposed of in household waste or flushed down toilets can contaminate water supplies
- Pharmaceutical compounds have been detected in rivers, lakes, and drinking water
- Many medications are not removed by standard water treatment processes
- Environmental exposure can harm aquatic life and ecosystems

### Public Safety
- Prevents accidental ingestion by children or pets
- Reduces the risk of medication misuse or abuse
- Decreases the likelihood of medication mix-ups
- Prevents expired medications from being used when they may be ineffective or harmful

### Legal Requirements
- The Environmental Protection Act requires that medicinal waste be disposed of correctly
- Healthcare waste regulations mandate special handling for pharmaceutical waste
- NHS and regulatory guidance recommends returning unwanted medications to pharmacies

### Best Practices for Bringing Medications

- Inform pharmacy staff if you are returning controlled substances
- Place liquid medications in leak-proof containers
- Bring medications during regular pharmacy hours

## Special Considerations

### Controlled Drugs

- The pharmacy will follow legal requirements for controlled drug destruction

### Sharps Disposal

- Ask our pharmacy team about our sharps disposal program

### Large Quantity Disposal

- Call ahead if possible so we can prepare for the volume
- Bring medications in secured bags or containers
- Our staff can assist with unloading and sorting if needed

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Is there a charge for medication disposal?
No, medication disposal is a free service provided by Cornwell's Chemists as part of our commitment to community health and environmental responsibility.

### What happens to medications after I return them?
Returned medications are securely stored at the pharmacy in designated containers until they are collected by a licensed waste management company. They are then transported to specialized facilities where they are destroyed through high-temperature incineration, which is the environmentally preferred method of pharmaceutical disposal.

### Can I return someone else's medication?
Yes, you can return medications on behalf of a family member, friend, or neighbor. You do not need to provide identification except in cases involving controlled substances.

### Should I remove medications from their packaging?
No, please keep medications in their original packaging when possible. This helps our pharmacy team identify the medications and ensure they are disposed of appropriately.

### What should I do with the medication containers after use?
- Plastic medication bottles: Remove labels with personal information and recycle
- Blister packs: Generally not recyclable; dispose in regular waste
- Glass bottles: Recycle after removing labels with personal information
- Medication tubes: Squeeze out as much product as possible before disposal

### Can I flush medications down the toilet if I can't get to a pharmacy?
No, flushing medications down the toilet or sink is not recommended as many pharmaceuticals can pass through wastewater treatment systems and enter rivers and groundwater. Always bring them to a pharmacy for proper disposal.
