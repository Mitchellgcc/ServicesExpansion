Our current total monthly service revenue is £99,303.95, which is a solid base. Our "Weight Loss" category at £37,955.33 is a standout performer and aligns perfectly with the market summary's top opportunity.



1. Metabolic & Weight Management (GLP-1 Dominance)
Current Group Performance (Apr 2025): £37,955.33
May 2026 Group Target: £76,000 (+£38,044.67 monthly)
Maximum Push Strategy & Breakdown - Examples:
Core GLP-1 Service Expansion:
Action Example: Each of your 10 pharmacies aims to recruit an average of 6 new private GLP-1 patients per week (total 60 new patients/week for the group). This builds towards the target of ~300 new active patients over several months. A "New Patient Onboarding Fee" of £50 could be charged for the initial consultation, GLP-1 initiation, and first pen, separate from the ongoing monthly medication cost.
Revenue Expectation Example: 300 new patients x £125/month (medication + basic monitoring) = £37,500. Add onboarding fees for new patients each month.
Value-Added Service Integration (High Margin):
Action 1 (Baseline Labs Example): "Weight Loss Starter Pack - £199" including initial IP consultation, first month's GLP-1 (e.g., Wegovy starting dose, pharmacy cost ~£70-£90), and a voucher for a partner clinic (or in-house phlebotomy) for baseline bloods (HbA1c, Lipids, Renal Profile - lab cost ~£30-£40). Your service fee component is profitable. 30% of 300 new patients = 90 patients/month x ~£50 net profit from labs = £4,500. (Also Female / Male specific packages to be thought about) 
Action 2 (Dietitian/Coaching Upsell Example):
Tier 1 "GLP-1 Support (£30/month extra)": Monthly pharmacist check-in (virtual or in-person), access to curated online resources, basic diet sheets.
Tier 2 "GLP-1 Premium Support (£50/month extra)": As Tier 1, plus one 30-min virtual dietitian consult per month (partnered or in-house).
Target: 60 patients on Tier 1 = £1,800. 60 patients on Tier 2 = £3,000. Total: £4,800.
IP Capacity: Significantly increase Pharmacist Independent Prescriber availability or establish robust partnerships with Telehealth prescribing services.
Marketing: Implement targeted SMS funnels, local online ads, and in-pharmacy promotion for the comprehensive private weight management service.
Standardisation: Replicate best practices from top-performing pharmacies (e.g., Wolstanton's model) across the group.
Stock & CQC: Ensure robust GLP-1 stock management and full CQC compliance for all prescribing activities.

2. Women’s Hormonal & Reproductive Health (HRT & Expanded Contraception)
Current Group Performance (Apr 2025): £9,368.85 (NHS Contraception + Deltera PGD)

Follow-up consults at £75. Target 7 new packages per pharmacy per month (70 group-wide).
Revenue Expectation Example: 70 packages x £149 = £10,430. (This single initiative already pushes hard towards the overall £15k additional target).
OTC Gina (Estradiol Tablets) Sales Drive:
Action Example: Pharmacists proactively identify eligible women during other interactions (e.g., collecting other meds, NMS). "Ask About Gina" shelf talkers. Target 10 packs/pharmacy/month.
Revenue Expectation Example: 100 packs x £30 = £3,000.
Expanded Private Contraception & Specialist PGDs:
Action Example: Market a "Private Contraception Consultation - £25" leading to supply of 3-6 months of oral contraception (cost of meds additional, with pharmacy margin). Explore PGD for testosterone cream for specific low libido/menopausal symptoms post-consultation (if demand and clinical governance supports this niche). Aim for 15 new private contraception patients per pharmacy per month.
Revenue Expectation Example: 150 new patients x £25 consult + average £10 profit on meds = £5,250.
Optimise NHS Contraception Service (PCS) & Pharmacy First (UTI):
Action Example: Ensure all pharmacies actively offer PCS initiation and ongoing supply, aiming for a 20% increase in current PCS consults (£3,100 -> £3,720). Ensure 100% of uncomplicated UTI presentations are managed via Pharmacy First.
Revenue Expectation Example: Growth here supports the overall £24,369 target.
Operational Enablers: Specialist training for pharmacists in menopause and advanced contraception. Targeted marketing for menopause services. CQC registration for clinics if established. Align stockholding tightly with HRT formularies.

3. Travel Health (Major Untapped Private Service)
Current Group Performance (Apr 2025): £0.00
May 2026 Group Target: £30,000 (+£30,000 monthly)

Total: 10 pharmacies x 10 patients/week x (average £90 vaccine revenue + £10 malaria profit) = £10,000/week = £40,000/month. (The £30k target is achievable with this volume and average spend).
Operational Enablers - Examples:
Training & Accreditation: Group contract with a travel health training provider. Pharmacists complete Yellow Fever certification online and practical.
Stock & PGDs: Central preferred supplier for travel vaccines to ensure availability and pricing. Group-wide PGD for all travel vaccines and common anti-malarials (e.g., via a national PGD provider).

8. Core Vaccinations (Flu, COVID, RSV)
Current Group Performance (Apr 2025): £24,828.92 (from COVID)
May 2026 Group Target: £15,000 (-£9,828.92 monthly from April's COVID peak, but establishing a higher, more diversified baseline)
Maximum Push Strategy & Breakdown - Examples:
Normalize Post-COVID Volumes & Sustain Flu Share:
Action Example (Flu): Target delivering 1000-1500 NHS Flu Jabs per pharmacy over the 4-5 month flu season. (10,000-15,000 jabs group-wide). Average monthly revenue during season: (10,000 jabs x £10 fee / 4 months) = £25,000. Off-season this drops, hence the £15k average target when combined with other jabs.
Action Example (COVID): Participate fully in any nationally commissioned booster campaigns. If a campaign runs for 2 months delivering 500 jabs/pharmacy at £12/jab = £6,000/pharmacy for that period.
Integrate New NHS Vaccinations (e.g., RSV):
Action Example: If RSV service is commissioned at £15/dose, and each pharmacy delivers to 50 eligible patients per month during its season.
Revenue Expectation Example: 500 patients x £15 = £7,500 for that month.
The £15,000 monthly average target is a composite of these activities, with Flu being the largest regular contributor seasonally, and COVID/new vaccines adding variable income.
Operational Enablers: Robust appointment booking systems. Efficient clinic flow during peak seasons. Proactive patient communication about all available vaccinations. Adequate staffing.
