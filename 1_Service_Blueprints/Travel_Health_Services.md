### Pillar 2: The Patient Profile & Eligibility

*   **Target Patient Profile:**
    *   **Clinical:** All travellers, segmented into risk groups: Leisure/Holiday (families, short trips), Business (frequent/long-stay), and Specialist (backpackers, VFR, complex itineraries, pre-existing conditions).
    *   **Psychographic:** Individuals and businesses seeking a convenient, expert "one-stop shop" for travel health. They value the peace of mind from a comprehensive, personalised risk assessment and will pay for expertise and convenience.
*   **Strict Clinical Exclusion Criteria (Immediate GP/Specialist Referral):**
    *   Complex immunocompromise (e.g., recent chemotherapy, transplant recipients).
    *   Significant, unstable chronic illness (e.g., severe heart failure) where fitness to travel is questionable.
    *   Patients for whom we cannot provide required live vaccines due to contraindications (e.g., pregnancy and Yellow Fever vaccine, unless travel is unavoidable and risks are documented).

---

### Pillar 3: The Clinical & Commercial Rationale (The "Why")

*   **Clinical Rationale:** Our service operates in line with the **Faculty of Travel Medicine's "Good Practice Guidance for Providing a Travel Health Service"** and uses real-time, country-specific risk information from **NaTHNaC**. Every consultation involves a formal, documented risk assessment covering the individual, destination, and activities. This ensures our advice is personalised, evidence-based, and minimises risk. We adhere to "The Green Book" for all vaccine administration.
*   **Competitive Differentiation:** We are a **Travel Health Concierge**, not just a "jab and go" service. Our differentiator is the *depth* of our consultation. We offer advanced advice on non-vaccine preventable diseases, medical kits, and managing pre-existing conditions abroad. Our "Concierge Packs" (with sterile needle kits, water purification, specific insect repellents) provide tangible, value-added products that simplify preparation and create a crucial secondary revenue stream.

2.  **Consultation:** A pharmacist conducts a full risk assessment. Using NaTHNaC data, a personalised travel health plan is created (vaccinations, malaria prophylaxis, preventive advice).
3.  **Vaccination & Dispensing:** All necessary vaccinations and anti-malarials administered/dispensed in the same appointment where possible. The "Concierge Pack" is provided.
4.  **Documentation:** Patient receives a personalised travel health report, vaccination record, and, if applicable, a validated International Certificate of Vaccination or Prophylaxis (ICVP) for Yellow Fever.
5.  **Follow-up:** For multi-dose vaccine courses (e.g., Rabies), a follow-up schedule is booked. Post-travel consultations are offered.
