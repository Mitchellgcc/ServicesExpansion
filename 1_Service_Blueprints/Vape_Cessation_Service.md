# Cornwells Chemists: Vape Cessation Service Blueprint

## **1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY**

This document outlines the strategic blueprint for a **Pharmacy-Led Vape-Free Programme**, a new clinical service designed to address the growing public health issue of nicotine dependence from e-cigarettes. This service establishes Cornwells as a proactive, modern healthcare provider catering to a younger demographic. The programme will leverage evidence-based behavioural support and expert pharmacological advice (Nicotine Replacement Therapy) to guide patients towards successfully quitting vaping. This service represents a new, high-demand revenue stream and reinforces our role as an essential community health hub.

## **2. OPERATIONAL READINESS FRAMEWORK**

### **a) Clinical Governance & Quality Assurance**
*   **Core Principle:** The service will adapt the evidence-base from NICE guidance on smoking cessation (NG209) for vaping, focusing on behavioural support and NRT pharmacology.
*   **Oversight:** The central "Clinical Governance Committee" will approve and review the service protocol, patient-facing materials, and outcomes.
*   **Pharmacist Competency:** All delivering pharmacists must complete accredited training on smoking cessation and receive specific training on the nuances of vape cessation (e.g., high nicotine concentrations in disposables, behavioural triggers).

### **b) Workforce Development & Training Strategy**
*   **Lead Pharmacists:** Will be trained to deliver structured behavioural support interventions, using techniques like Motivational Interviewing.
*   **Healthcare Assistants (HCAs):** Can be trained to conduct carbon monoxide (CO) monitoring, which, while primarily for smoking, can be a powerful motivational tool to show patients they are no longer inhaling harmful substances.

### **c) Digital Platform Integration ("Pharmacy+ Access")**
*   **Booking & Triage:** Patients can book their initial assessment and follow-up support sessions online. A pre-consultation questionnaire will gather information on vaping habits and motivation.
*   **Support Tools:** The platform can host a "Quit Diary," provide links to trusted resources (e.g., NHS Better Health), and send automated motivational messages or reminders for follow-up appointments.

## **3. DETAILED SERVICE BLUEPRINT**

### **Core Proposition: "The Vape-Free Programme"**
A structured, multi-session programme providing expert advice, behavioural support, and a tailored Nicotine Replacement Therapy (NRT) plan to help individuals quit vaping for good.

### **Clinical Rationale**
While vaping is considered less harmful than smoking, it is not risk-free, and nicotine is highly addictive. Many individuals who start vaping find it extremely difficult to stop on their own. This service provides a formal, evidence-based pathway that is proven to be more effective than willpower alone. It combines behavioural support (addressing the psychological addiction) with pharmacotherapy (managing the physical withdrawal symptoms).

### **Competitive Differentiation**
*   **Clinical Credibility:** We are a trusted medical environment, a stark contrast to unregulated advice from vape shops or online forums.
*   **NRT Expertise:** As pharmacists, we are the undisputed experts in NRT, ensuring patients get the right product, at the right strength, for the right duration, and use it correctly—dramatically increasing success rates.
*   **Accessible & Non-Judgmental:** Our community presence makes us highly accessible. We can create a supportive, non-judgmental space that is more appealing to younger people than traditional, often older-skewed, "stop smoking" clinics.
*   **Holistic Health Link:** We can link quitting vaping to tangible health improvements, such as improved cardiovascular health (monitored via blood pressure checks) and financial savings.

### **Patient Profile**
*   **The Accidental Vaper (18-30):** Started with disposable vapes socially and is now using them daily, concerned about addiction, cost, and unknown long-term health risks.
*   **The Parent:** Vapes but wants to quit as a positive role model for their children or due to concerns about second-hand vapour.
*   **The Ex-Smoker:** Successfully switched from smoking to vaping years ago but now feels "tethered" to their vape and wants to be completely nicotine-free.

### **Service Tiers & Patient Journey**

**Step 1: The Initial Assessment & Quit Plan (£30)**
*   **Duration:** 25-minute private consultation.
*   **Activities:**
    *   **Assess Dependence:** Detailed history of vaping (device type, nicotine strength, frequency) to understand level of addiction.
    *   **Identify Triggers:** Discuss social, environmental, and emotional triggers.
    *   **Motivational Interviewing:** Explore reasons for quitting and build motivation.
    *   **Set a Quit Date:** Agree on a specific date to stop vaping.
    *   **Create NRT Plan:** Recommend and explain the use of an appropriate NRT product (e.g., patch for baseline nicotine + gum/spray for acute cravings). This is a crucial element where pharmacist expertise shines.
    *   **Behavioural Strategy:** Provide practical tips for managing cravings and trigger situations.
*   **Outcome:** A personalised, written quit plan and the patient's first supply of NRT (sold separately).

**Step 2: The Weekly Support Programme (£60 for 4 weeks of follow-up)**
*   **Duration:** Four 10-minute follow-up sessions (in-person or telephone).
*   **Activities:**
    *   **Week 1:** Review progress since quit date, troubleshoot challenges, reinforce motivation.
    *   **Week 2-3:** Monitor NRT use and adjust dosage if necessary. Discuss and problem-solve any difficult situations encountered.
    *   **Week 4:** Celebrate success, and plan for long-term maintenance to prevent relapse. Create a "weaning off NRT" plan.
*   **Outcome:** Sustained support during the most challenging phase of quitting, significantly increasing the likelihood of success.
