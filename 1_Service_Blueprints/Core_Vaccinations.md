# 8. Core Vaccinations

## Pillar 1: The Core Service Proposition

Our vaccination services are structured across three distinct pillars, transforming our pharmacies from simple vaccine providers into comprehensive immunisation hubs for individuals, businesses, and the NHS.

### 1. Private Vaccination & Travel Health Clinic

**Core Offering:** A premium, convenient, and expert-led private vaccination service for individuals and families seeking proactive health management, travel protection, or access to vaccines outside of NHS eligibility.

*   **Consultation Process:**
    *   **Initial Booking:** Patients book a "Vaccination Consultation" online or in-pharmacy. Travel patients complete a detailed pre-travel risk assessment form at booking.
    *   **Pharmacist-led Consultation (Tiered):** In a private room, our pharmacist conducts a full needs assessment. Consultation slots are tiered (e.g., 15 mins for a single vaccine, 30-40 mins for complex travel health) to ensure adequate time for consent and paperwork.
    *   **Immediate Administration:** All required vaccines are administered in the same appointment, where clinically appropriate.
*   **Value-Added Services:**
    *   **Unified Digital Platform ("Pharmacy+ Access"):** Patients receive a secure digital pass and a printable certificate detailing their vaccination history via our unified platform. This system consolidates their entire health record with us and provides automated reminders for subsequent doses or annual boosters. It also serves as the gateway to our "Pharmacy+ Access" membership.
    *   **Transparent Pricing:** We will publish a clear price list for all private vaccines, including bundled offers (e.g., "Family Travel Trio"), to build trust and reinforce our premium service.
    *   **Certified Yellow Fever Centre:** We will seek full NaTHNaC certification to operate as an approved Yellow Fever Centre at our flagship travel health hubs.
    *   **Proactive Health Campaigns:** We will run seasonal campaigns for private vaccines during off-peak NHS periods (e.g., "Shingles Awareness Month") to drive uptake.
*   **Follow-up Process:**
    *   **Automated Reminders:** Our unified digital platform automatically notifies patients when subsequent doses for multi-dose courses (e.g., Hepatitis B, Rabies) or annual boosters are due.

### 2. Corporate & Occupational Health Services

**Core Offering:** A B2B service providing tailored vaccination programs to protect employee health, ensure regulatory compliance, and support corporate wellness initiatives, governed by a formal Service Level Agreement (SLA).

*   **Consultation & Delivery Process:**
    *   **Needs Assessment:** We consult with the business to understand their industry-specific risks (e.g., healthcare, travel, agriculture) and employee needs.
    *   **Flexible Delivery Models:**
        1.  **On-Site Clinics:** We deploy a team of pharmacist vaccinators to the client's workplace for maximum convenience (ideal for seasonal flu or campaign-based programs).
        2.  **Secure e-Voucher System:** The company purchases a block of secure, trackable e-vouchers that employees can redeem for specific vaccinations at any of our pharmacy locations.
*   **Value-Added Services:**
    *   **Anonymised Reporting:** We provide businesses with anonymised data on vaccination uptake to support their health and safety reporting.
    *   **Integrated Wellness Packages:** We bundle vaccination services with our Health Screening & Monitoring offerings for a comprehensive corporate wellness solution.
*   **Follow-up & Account Management:**
    *   **Dedicated Account Manager:** A single point of contact for booking, billing, and reporting.
    *   **Annual Program Review:** We meet with the client annually to review the success of the program and plan for the upcoming year.

### 3. NHS Commissioned Services

**Core Offering:** A reliable and accessible partnership with the NHS to deliver national immunisation programs, focusing on increasing uptake in our local communities and supporting public health goals.

*   **Service Delivery Process:**
    *   We deliver the full suite of commissioned services (e.g., COVID-19, Seasonal Flu) in strict accordance with NHS protocols and Patient Group Directions (PGDs).
    *   We leverage both the National Booking System and walk-in appointments to maximise accessibility for eligible patient cohorts.
*   **Value-Added Services (Our Commitment to the NHS):**
    *   **Community Outreach:** We actively promote NHS campaigns to our existing patient base to improve awareness and uptake.
    *   **Targeted Support:** We focus on reaching under-vaccinated and hard-to-reach groups within our local communities.
    *   **Efficient Reporting:** We ensure timely and accurate data submission to NHS systems to support national public health monitoring.

### Pillar 2: The Patient Profile & Eligibility

*   **Target Patient Profile:**
    *   **1. Private Clinic:** Individuals and families seeking vaccines not available to them on the NHS (e.g., Chickenpox, Shingles for under-65s), or those who value the convenience of a pharmacy setting for routine jabs (e.g., annual flu).
    *   **2. Corporate & Occupational Health:** Businesses of all sizes seeking to protect their workforce from seasonal flu, or needing to comply with occupational health requirements for specific roles (e.g., Hepatitis B for at-risk staff).
    *   **3. NHS Support:** Local GP practices and NHS commissioners requiring additional, flexible capacity to meet national immunisation programme targets (e.g., seasonal flu, COVID-19 boosters).
*   **Strict Clinical Exclusion Criteria (Referral to GP/Specialist):**
    *   As defined in Chapter 6 of the Green Book ("Contraindications and special considerations").
    *   Known severe anaphylactic reaction to a previous dose of the vaccine or to any component of the vaccine.
    *   Acute severe febrile illness (vaccination should be postponed).
    *   Specific contraindications for live vaccines (e.g., MMR, Varicella) in patients who are clinically immunosuppressed or pregnant. All decisions will be governed by the relevant Patient Group Direction (PGD) or an Independent Prescriber's assessment.

### Pillar 3: The Clinical & Commercial Rationale (The "Why")

*   **Clinical Rationale:** Our entire service operates in absolute adherence to UK Health Security Agency's (UKHSA) "Immunisation against infectious disease" (The Green Book), with a formal process for quarterly reviews to integrate any guideline updates. We provide safe, effective, and convenient access to immunisations, which increases population vaccine coverage and alleviates pressure on GP services. By offering a comprehensive range of private vaccines, we fill crucial gaps in the routine NHS schedule for individuals and employers.
*   **Competitive Differentiation:** Our key differentiator is **expert accessibility**. Unlike GP surgeries with limited appointment slots, we offer pre-bookable and walk-in appointments six days a week. We will strategically develop our workforce, using both **Independent Prescribers** at key sites to manage complex cases and **Registered Pharmacy Technicians** to deliver vaccines under PGDs, maximising our capacity and efficiency. Our corporate service is distinguished by on-site delivery at scale, minimising disruption for businesses and maximising uptake.

### Pillar 4: The High-Level Clinical Pathway

1.  **Book & Triage:** The patient/client books an appointment online or walks in. A digital pre-consultation screening form is completed to assess eligibility and check for contraindications based on Green Book criteria.
2.  **Pharmacist Consultation:** In a private consultation room, the pharmacist verifies the patient's clinical suitability, reviews their immunisation history, discusses the risks and benefits, and obtains informed consent as per the standards in Chapter 2 of the Green Book.
3.  **Vaccination:** The vaccine is administered using the correct technique and anatomical site as specified in Chapter 4 of the Green Book ("Immunisation procedures").
4.  **Post-Vaccination & Record Keeping:** The patient is observed for an appropriate period if necessary (e.g., 15 minutes post-COVID-19 jab). The vaccination event is recorded on our Patient Medication Record (PMR) system. A notification is automatically sent to the patient's GP and, where applicable, the national immunisation register (NIMS) to ensure the patient's lifelong health record is complete.
5.  **Scheduling & Follow-up:** The patient is provided with a record of their vaccination and clearly informed when any subsequent doses are due. Our system sends automated reminders for booster doses or the next vaccine in a course.
