# Enhanced NHS Advanced and Clinical Services

## Pillar 1: The Core Service Proposition - "The Dual-Lane Pharmacy"

**Core Offering:** A "dual-lane" model offering patients a clear choice. They can access the standard, high-quality **NHS Pharmacy First** service, or they can opt for our **"Pharmacy+ Access Plan"**—a private, direct-to-pharmacist consultation service for those who require more speed, convenience, or in-depth support.

*   **Consultation Process (Pharmacy+ Access Plan):**
    *   **Same-Day Booking & Tiered Pricing:** Patients book and pay for a guaranteed 20-minute, same-day consultation slot online. Pricing is tiered based on consultation complexity (e.g., Core, Women's Health, Dermatology).
    *   **Pharmacist-Led Consultation:** In a private room, our pharmacist conducts a comprehensive assessment of the patient's needs, with technology automatically populating PGDs and prescriptions to ensure an efficient, sub-18-minute workflow.
    *   **Immediate Action:** Based on the assessment, the pharmacist will provide immediate treatment under a PGD, issue a private prescription, or provide a formal referral letter to the patient's GP if the condition is outside the scope of the service.

*   **Value-Added Services (Why Patients Pay):**
    *   **Guaranteed Access & Speed:** The fee guarantees a same-day, scheduled appointment, eliminating the uncertainty and delay of securing a GP appointment.
    *   **Extended Consultation Time:** A dedicated 20-minute slot allows for a more thorough discussion and advice compared to a standard, high-volume NHS service.
    *   **Unified Digital Platform ("Pharmacy+ Access"):** Patients receive a digital summary of their consultation via our unified platform, which they can add to their single longitudinal health record. The platform also serves as the booking and payment portal and is the gateway to our "Pharmacy+ Access" membership for enhanced benefits.
    *   **Discreet & Convenient:** Ideal for sensitive issues or for working professionals who cannot wait for a GP appointment.

*   **Follow-up Process:**
    *   Clear "safety-netting" advice is provided to all patients. Consultation outcomes are communicated to the patient's GP via **GP Connect Messaging** where available, ensuring seamless and immediate continuity of care.

### Pillar 2: The Patient Profile & Eligibility

*   **Target Patient Profile:**
    *   **Clinical:** Patients with symptoms of low-acuity, uncomplicated conditions suitable for community pharmacy management. Eligibility for each specific condition will be strictly defined by our digital triage tool, which embeds NICE CKS clinical algorithms.
    *   **Psychographic:** Patients who value speed and convenience and are willing to pay a premium to bypass GP waiting times. This includes busy professionals, parents with young children, or those who simply want an immediate consultation and, if appropriate, treatment.
*   **Strict Clinical Exclusion Criteria (Immediate GP/Specialist Referral):**
    *   Any patient presenting with symptoms that meet the "red flag" criteria as defined by the embedded NICE CKS algorithm. The system will automatically deflect these patients before a booking is confirmed, advising them to contact their GP or 111.
    *   Patients whose symptoms fall outside the defined scope of the PGD for a specific treatment.
    *   **Example (UTI):** Men, pregnant women, catheterised patients, or women with recurrent UTIs (2+ in 6 months) would be automatically excluded by the digital triage.

### Pillar 3: The Clinical & Commercial Rationale (The "Why")

*   **Clinical Rationale:** This service operates in absolute adherence to established national guidelines. The "dual-lane" model ensures that all patients receive care that is safe and effective, with a clear choice between the standard NHS pathway and a premium private alternative.
*   **Competitive Differentiation:** Our differentiator is not a different clinical standard, but **guaranteed, immediate access to that standard, powered by a more efficient workforce model.** We will aggressively leverage the new regulations allowing trained **Pharmacy Technicians** to supply medicines under PGDs for common conditions. This frees up pharmacist time to focus on the more complex "Pharmacy+ Access" consultations, creating a highly efficient and scalable delivery model that is difficult for competitors to replicate.

### Pillar 4: The High-Level Clinical Pathway

1.  **Book & Triage:** Patient books a "Pharmacy+ Access" appointment online and completes a **dynamic digital triage form powered by a NICE-CKS clinical algorithm.** The form automatically flags any "red flag" answers and advises the patient to contact their GP or 111, preventing inappropriate bookings.
2.  **Consultation:** The patient attends their scheduled appointment. The pharmacist reviews the triage form and conducts a consultation following the specific clinical pathway.
3.  **Diagnosis & Action:** Based on the pathway, the pharmacist reaches a decision.
    *   **Treatment:** If criteria are met, treatment is supplied via a PGD or private prescription.
    *   **Advice Only:** If no treatment is required, advice is given.
    *   **Referral:** If criteria are not met or red flags are present, the patient is referred to their GP with a structured handover note.
4.  **Record & Communicate:** The entire consultation is recorded on the patient's record. A summary is sent to the patient, and a notification is sent to their GP's surgery via GP Connect Messaging to ensure continuity of care.
