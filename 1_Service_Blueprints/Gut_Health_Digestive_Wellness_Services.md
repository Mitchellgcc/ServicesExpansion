# Category 7: Gut Health & Digestive Wellness Services

## Pillar 1: The Core Service Proposition - The Tiered Gut Health Clinic

**Core Offering:** A pharmacist-led, evidence-based clinic offering tiered pathways for patients with persistent digestive issues. We provide a structured journey from diagnosis to management, grounded in clinical evidence and transparent pricing.

*   **The Tiered Pathways:**
    *   **Foundation Pathway (£99):** A comprehensive initial assessment including a pharmacist consultation (informed by a pre-visit e-questionnaire) and one foundational diagnostic test (e.g., Coeliac POCT, H. Pylori).
    *   **Resolve Pathway (£199):** Includes everything in the Foundation pathway, plus a second diagnostic test (e.g., Calprotectin) and a starter pack from our curated probiotic formulary.
    *   **Optimize Pathway (£349):** Includes everything in the Resolve pathway, plus a follow-up tele-session with a registered dietitian and a repeat diagnostic test to track progress.

*   **Consultation Process (The "Triage, Test, Treat/Refer" Pathway):**
    *   **Step 1: Pre-Visit Digital Triage:** Before the appointment, the patient completes a mandatory, auto-scored Rome IV e-questionnaire. This gathers essential data and screens for red flags, making the live consultation highly efficient.
    *   **Step 2: Pharmacist Consultation & Testing:** A trained pharmacist reviews the e-questionnaire results, conducts a focused consultation, and arranges the necessary diagnostic tests from our partner labs, which operate under strict Service Level Agreements (SLAs) for turnaround times.
    *   **Step 3: Personalised Action Plan (Treat or Refer):** A management plan is co-created based on the chosen pathway and test results.

*   **Value-Added Services:**
    *   **Curated Formulary:** We provide a focused formulary of evidence-based products, including NICE-recommended Tier 1 therapies for IBS (like peppermint oil) and specific probiotic strains with proven efficacy.
    *   **GP Partnership:** We position ourselves as a partner to GPs, providing them with structured, clinically relevant data and referrals via the secure GP Connect messaging service.
    *   **Corporate Wellness:** We offer a "Healthy-Gut Workplace" package for businesses, including on-site screening and educational webinars.

*   **Follow-up Process:**
    *   A follow-up consultation (via phone or secure video on our platform) is included in the "Resolve" and "Optimize" pathways to discuss test results and refine the management plan.

### Pillar 2: The Patient Profile & Eligibility

*   **Target Patient Profile:**
    *   **Clinical:** Adults aged 18+ with persistent, non-acute digestive symptoms (e.g., bloating, abdominal pain, altered bowel habit) for over 6 months, who have not yet received a formal diagnosis.
    *   **Psychographic:** Patients feeling confused by "Dr. Google" and the wellness market, seeking a credible, scientific first port of call. They are motivated to find the root cause of their issues, not just a quick fix.
*   **Strict Clinical Exclusion Criteria (Immediate GP/Specialist Referral):**
    *   Presence of "red flag" symptoms including: unexplained weight loss, rectal bleeding, family history of bowel/ovarian cancer, or a change in bowel habit to looser stools for >6 weeks in a person >60 years old (as per NICE Guideline CG61). Our digital triage is designed to identify these patients before consultation.
    *   Patients with a new diagnosis of Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD), Coeliac Disease, or any suspected malignancy must be managed by their GP/specialist. Our role is to facilitate this referral with high-quality data.

### Pillar 3: The Clinical & Commercial Rationale (The "Why")

*   **Clinical Rationale:** Our service is built on NICE guidelines (CG61, NG20) and the Rome IV criteria. We act as a responsible "Triage, Test, and Treat/Refer" service, using validated diagnostics to provide clinically meaningful data. We explicitly reject the use of non-validated tests, such as IgG "food sensitivity" panels, which lack diagnostic validity according to NICE. This evidence-based stance is the cornerstone of our clinical credibility.
*   **Competitive Differentiation:** Our key differentiators are **clinical credibility and operational efficiency**. Unlike online wellness companies, our service is delivered by trained healthcare professionals in a regulated environment. We will leverage **trained pharmacy technicians** for sample handling and capturing diet histories, freeing up pharmacist time for high-value clinical decision-making. This efficient workforce model, combined with our robust clinical governance, creates a highly defensible market position.

### Pillar 4: The High-Level Clinical Pathway

1.  **Book & Complete e-Triage:** Patient books their chosen pathway and completes the mandatory Rome IV e-questionnaire, which screens for red-flag symptoms.
2.  **Consultation & Sample Collection:** The pharmacist conducts a focused consultation. Technicians assist with capturing relevant history and handling test samples.
3.  **Test Recommendation & Consent:** The pharmacist confirms the tests included in the pathway and gains patient consent.
4.  **Action Plan (Initial):** The patient leaves with an initial management plan (e.g., lifestyle advice, a Tier 1 therapy to try) pending test results.
5.  **Results & Follow-up:** Test results are returned within the specified SLA. A follow-up consultation is scheduled to discuss the results.
    *   **Scenario A (Clear Result):** A diagnosis of IBS is likely, or a simple issue is identified. The management plan is refined.
    *   **Scenario B (Positive/High-Risk Result):** The pharmacist explains the result and generates a formal, structured referral letter, which is dispatched instantly to the GP via GP Connect.
