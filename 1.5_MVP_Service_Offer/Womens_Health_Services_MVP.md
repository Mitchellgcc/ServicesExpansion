# Women's Health Services: MVP Service Offer

### **Objective**
To validate direct-to-consumer demand for private menopause-related advice, which is currently a zero-revenue area, using a low-cost, non-prescribing consultation model.

---

### **The MVP: "Menopause Symptom Review"**

*   **Full Vision Reminder:** A dual-clinic for Menopause (with BMS-accredited specialists providing body-identical HRT) and complex Contraception.
*   **Current State Reminder:** Only NHS Contraception referrals. £0 from private menopause services.

### **MVP Implementation**

1.  **Action:**
    *   At a pilot site, offer a 15-minute, private "Menopause Symptomer Review" consultation with a pharmacist.
    *   Crucially, this service **does not require a prescribing qualification**, removing a significant barrier to entry.

2.  **Process:**
    *   The pharmacist uses the free, standardized **Greene Climacteric Scale questionnaire** on paper to assess the patient's symptoms in a structured way.
    *   The pharmacist will be trained to explain each section of the scale to the patient.

3.  **The Offer:**
    *   A fixed fee of **£25**.
    *   For this, the patient receives:
        *   A completed, scored symptom sheet which they can take with them.
        *   A pre-prepared information pack containing NICE patient guidelines on Menopause and information on the benefits and risks of HRT.
    *   The service empowers the patient for a more effective and informed consultation with their GP.

4.  **Success Metric & Goal:**
    *   **Goal:** Measure the latent demand for accessible, expert menopause advice in the community pharmacy setting.
    *   **Metric:** Achieve **10-15 paid consultations** within the first month. This level of interest would strongly validate the business case for investing in a full, prescriber-led Menopause & HRT clinic.
