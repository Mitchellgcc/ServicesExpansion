# Enhanced NHS Services: MVP Service Offer

### **Objective**
To test if a premium, paid-for convenience layer can be built on top of the existing, high-performing NHS Pharmacy First service, creating a new private revenue stream from the current patient base.

---

### **The MVP: "Pharmacy First Plus"**

*   **Full Vision Reminder:** A "Dual-Lane Pharmacy" where patients can seamlessly choose between standard NHS care and a premium, private alternative for a wide range of conditions.
*   **Existing Service Status:** This is the highest-performing service category (£36,732/month), but it is entirely funded by the NHS. This MVP tests the **monetisation of convenience** for this successful service.

### **MVP Implementation**

1.  **Action:**
    *   At one pilot site, focus on the single most common Pharmacy First indication, which is typically **uncomplicated UTIs in women**.
    *   This provides a large, consistent sample of existing NHS patients to test the offer on.

2.  **Process:**
    *   Run a simple A/B test at the point of patient contact. When a patient presents with UTI symptoms, the pharmacy team offers two clear options:
        *   **Option A (The Standard):** "You can wait for the next available pharmacist for the free NHS service."
        *   **Option B (The Upgrade):** "If you prefer not to wait, you can book a guaranteed 'Pharmacy First Plus' appointment slot in the next hour for £25."
    *   The clinical delivery via the PGD is **identical** in both streams.

3.  **The Offer:**
    *   A guaranteed, same-day, 10-minute appointment for **£25**.
    *   The only product being sold is **speed, certainty, and convenience**.

4.  **Success Metric & Goal:**
    *   **Goal:** To understand the elasticity of demand for convenience and validate the 'dual-lane' model. What percentage of your core NHS patients will pay to upgrade?
    *   **Metric:** A **10% conversion rate**. If 1 in 10 patients who are offered the choice opt to pay the £25 fee, it demonstrates a significant and profitable market for adding a private, convenience-based layer across other NHS services.
