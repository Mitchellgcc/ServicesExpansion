The compass needle doesn't point north - instead, it points to a small, glowing coral heart symbol on the map. From this heart, rainbow pathways of light spread out across the map, connecting to various exotic destinations around the world in bright, cheerful colors. The map appears fresh and inviting, with bright blues for oceans and vibrant greens for continents. **Color Palette:** Bright brass and gold tones of the compass, vibrant blues and greens of the fresh map, and brilliant rainbow light pathways (coral, turquoise, lime, sunshine yellow), all suggesting joyful adventure and discovery. **Typography:** "Your Heart Knows the Way" in adventurous, explorer-inspired serif font with bright coral accents. **Sub-headline:** "Complete travel health protection for every journey." **Artistic Style:** Bright cartography meets cheerful adventure photography - optimistic, wanderlust-inducing, and full of colorful possibility. **Branding:** "Cornwells Chemists" styled like a cheerful travel stamp with designated logo space.
