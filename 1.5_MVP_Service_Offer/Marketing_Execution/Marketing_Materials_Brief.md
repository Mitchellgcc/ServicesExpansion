# MVP Services: Marketing Materials & Generation Prompts Brief

This document outlines the specific marketing collateral required to launch each of the 10 MVP service tests, including detailed prompts for AI-powered text and image generation, now enhanced with branch-specific demographic targeting.

**Core Brand & Tone Guidelines for all Prompts:**
*   **Brand:** Cornwells Chemists (a trusted, family-run UK pharmacy since 1835).
*   **Identity:** Professional, established, caring, community-focused, authoritative but approachable.
*   **Audience:** Based in Staffordshire/West Midlands, UK. Values trust, practicality, and community.
*   **Visuals:** Clean, professional, warm, and relatable to a UK audience. Consistently use Cornwells branding. Avoid generic American-style stock photos.

**Strategic Framework Add-Ins**

### Omni-Channel Amplification Plan
*Why: Print generates footfall, but 60-70% of first touch-points now start online. This plan bridges the gap.*
- **Weekly Google Business Profile (GBP) Posts:** A template for each branch to post weekly updates, aligning with the in-store focus.
- **3-Shot Instagram Story Storyboard:** A standardized template including a geo-sticker and a direct "Book Now" link sticker.
- **30-Word SMS Scripts:** Pharma-approved scripts to be triggered after EPS text alerts for relevant patient cohorts.

### Dynamic QR & UTM Taxonomy
*Why: Current QR codes only track clicks. We need UTM layers to attribute specific bookings and measure ROI accurately in Healthera/Charac.*
- **Naming Convention Table:** `svc-branch-ver` (e.g., `meno-wx-a`, `glp1-st4-b`).
- **Short-URL Policy:** Use a branded `bit.ly` to save space on A6/A7 print materials.
- **Dashboard Mock-up:** A conceptual framework for a Google Data Studio dashboard to visualize the funnel from QR scan to booking.

### Referral & Loyalty Hooks
*Why: Community pharmacies thrive on word-of-mouth. This formalizes and incentivizes it.*
- **"Bring-a-Friend" Vouchers:** A tear-off stub on A5 flyers offering a ¬£5 credit to both the referrer and the new customer.
- **Punch-Card Programs:** For recurring services like Menopause or Weight Management, the 6th review is free.
- **Prize Draw Poster:** A fortnightly draw for a pharmacy hamper to incentivize email sign-ups.

### Local-Partnership Grid
*Why: Leveraging local schools, gyms, and SMEs can cut customer acquisition costs to near-zero.*
- **Partnership Matrix:** A grid outlining partner types (e.g., local gym), contact scripts, and contra-deals (e.g., gym displays GLP-1 poster in exchange for free Men's Health MOTs for their staff).
- **Example Barter Deals:**
    - **Offer:** A free "Know Your Numbers" BP/Cholesterol check pop-up for a local community group (e.g., WI, Gardening Club, Mosque). **Get:** A slot in their newsletter and access to their member email list.
    - **Offer:** Vouchers for free staff flu jabs for a local high-end coffee shop. **Get:** A poster in their window and a space to stamp on their loyalty cards.
    - **Offer:** A free "inhaler technique" workshop for a primary school. **Get:** Permission to insert a Family Hub fridge magnet into every child's homework planner.

### Compliance & Risk Boilerplate
*Why: To avoid ASA complaints and CQC flags by ensuring all marketing materials are compliant from the start.*

#### Quick Compliance Checklist for Designers
- **No POM Promotion:** No brand or celebrity references to prescription-only medicines.
- **NHS Logo Integrity:** The NHS logo must only appear on materials 100% devoted to an NHS-funded service and must not be on the same face as a private service promotion.
- **Qualify Health Claims:** All health outcome statements must be prefixed with "may" or be qualified and evidence-based. Cite sources where appropriate.
- **Mandatory Disclaimers:** Include the correct MHRA/ASA disclaimer on every asset for weight-management, HRT, ED, TRT, or vaccinations.
- **Consent is Key:** All promotional contact (Email/SMS/WhatsApp) must be opt-in with a clear opt-out.

- **ASA CAP Code References:** Internal guidance on rules for "before/after" images and celebrity-style claims. (See CAP Code 12.12).
- **Permission Checklist:** A required checklist for distributing materials via school newsletters, community WhatsApp groups, etc.
- **No-Cash Compliance:**
    - **Images:** Generate images via AI or use Unsplash for free commercial use. Always add descriptive alt-text for accessibility.
    - **Music:** Only use tracks from Instagram/TikTok's "commercial sounds" library to avoid licence fees.
    - **NHS Branding:** Only use the official NHS logo variants permitted for the Pharmacy First service (guidelines are public and free).
- #### Legal / Compliance Copy Blocks
  *To be added verbatim in 6pt font on any poster/flyer that mentions outcomes, price, or medicine. See also: MHRA Blue Guide Ch 3 & 6, GPhC/MHRA Enforcement Notice 2025.*
  - **Weight-Management:** "Prescription-only medicines (POM) are supplied subject to eligibility and a clinical assessment. Average weight-loss varies. Not an alternative to a balanced diet and exercise. Source: NICE TA1026."
  - **Men's Health:** "We do not guarantee supply of prescription medicines. Services adhere to BSSM & NICE NG221 guidelines. Private prescriptions incur additional cost."
  - **Mental Health:** "This service provides information and sign-posting only. It is not crisis care. In an emergency, call 999."
  - **General Data Capture:** "Data processed under UK GDPR Article 6(1)(a). Consent may be withdrawn at any time. Text STOP to opt-out of SMS offers."

### Inclusive & Bilingual Elements
*Why: Stoke & Silverdale have a significant (9%) South-Asian population. Inclusivity is key to trust.*
- **Mini-Glossary:** Key lines like "Free NHS service" translated into Urdu/Punjabi for relevant branch materials.
- **Alt-Text Templates:** Pre-written, descriptive alt-text for all social media images to improve accessibility.

### Staff Enablement Kit
*Why: Print materials and digital campaigns fail if counter staff are not confident in explaining the services.*
- **1-Page Objection-Handling Cheat Sheet:** A simple, scannable guide for each service.
- **60-Second "Elevator Pitch" Audio:** Short audio files shareable via WhatsApp for staff to learn the key benefits of each service.
- **Staff-Driven Reach:**
    - **Uniform Hacks:** Create icon badges for uniforms ("Ask me about our üï∞Ô∏è after-school clinic") to turn staff into walking calls-to-action.
    - **Branded Totes:** Use branded tote bags for prescription deliveries, turning them into free moving billboards around local estates.

### Post-Pilot Retargeting Plan
*Why: To maintain momentum after a successful A/B test and convert initial interest into long-term custom.*
- **Custom Audience Build-Out:** Create audiences from QR code scanners and specific website page visitors.
- **Geo-Fenced Meta Retargeting:** A ¬£3/day campaign targeting the custom audience within a 1-2km radius for 14 days post-pilot.
- **Email Template:** A follow-up email to pilot participants offering "¬£5 off your next service."

#### Cross-Branch Implementation Tips
- **Icon-Sticker System:** Print a 5cm adhesive sticker of each branch icon (kettlebell, clock, etc.). Place on posters to create instant local relevance.
- **Local Hashtags:** Append e.g., `#WeepingCrossHealth`, `#ValeFit` on IG/TikTok to juice algorithmic localisation.
- **Language Snippets:** Keep bilingual lines to ‚â§4 words to satisfy ASA legibility (minimum 7pt).
- **Voucher Prefix:** Encode branch & persona: `WX-MENO-A`, `ST4-GLP-B`. Track redemptions weekly.
- **Geo-Fence Radii:** Affluent/commercial sites 2km, student/urban 1km (keeps CPM low).

## **STRATEGIC PRINTING ADVANTAGE: Free/Low-Cost Print Shop Access**

**A/B Testing Strategy:**
With free printing, you can afford to test multiple versions of each material simultaneously. This transforms MVP testing from "hope it works" to "find what works fastest."

**Recommended A/B Test Approach:**
1. **Version A:** Conservative, professional approach
2. **Version B:** Bold, benefit-led approach  
3. **Version C:** Price-focused value proposition

**Print Specifications for Professional Results:**
- **A4 Posters:** 200gsm silk or matt paper, full color
- **A5 Flyers:** 150gsm paper, full color, quantities of 500-1000 per test
- **A6 Leaflets:** 130gsm paper, folded, quantities of 200-500 per branch
- **Window Clings:** Vinyl static cling material
- **Counter Materials:** 300gsm card stock for durability

**Branch Customization Strategy:**
Print the same core message with branch-specific details (addresses, local landmarks, demographic hooks) to maximize local relevance.

**Rapid Iteration Protocol:**
Week 1-2: Test initial versions
Week 3: Print improved versions based on early feedback
Week 4: Final optimization before full rollout

## **Low-Cost / Zero-Cash Implementation Tactics**

### 1. Zero-Cash "Print-Plus" Hacks
*   **Prescription-Bag "Belts":** Print 6cm x 20cm paper belly-bands that slide over every dispensed bag. Rotate the service-of-the-week. This reaches 100% of active customers and sparks at-home conversations. (**Compliance Note:** To comply with NHS Identity rules, any band featuring the NHS logo must not have promotional material for private services on the same side. Either place the private ad on the reverse or remove the NHS logo entirely).
*   **Shelf "Wobblers" & Edge-Strips:** Use the branch-specific icon stickers to create micro die-cut cards. Clip them to OTC areas that correlate with services (e.g., reflux medication shelves get a "Gut Health Triage" wobbler).
*   **Mini-Z-Cards:** Create credit-card‚Äìsized foldable leaflets for discreet services like the Men's MOT or Travel Clinic. They are highly portable and an efficient use of A4 card stock.
*   **Door-Handle "Neck Tags":** For home delivery routes, have staff hang a tag on nearby doors: "üè† Your local pharmacy now offers ‚úì Free Health & Wellness Checks ‚úì Ear Wax Removal ‚úì Free Delivery". (**Compliance Note:** The message must be generic and not reference any specific Prescription-Only Medicines (POMs)).

### 2. Guerrilla Field-Work (Staff Time Only)
*   **Noticeboard Blitz:** Target branches in high-community areas (Silverdale, Abbey Hulton) should pin A5 flyers on every free community board (Co-ops, libraries, churches). Map the locations once and refresh monthly. (**Compliance Note:** Only post on boards where owner approval is granted. Log approved locations).
*   **School-Gate Hand-Ups:** For family-focused branches (Chadsmoor), have two staff in branded fleeces hand out fridge-magnet appointment cards to parents 15 minutes before pick-up. (**Compliance Note:** Must obtain written consent from the head teacher. Staff must have visible ID).
*   **Market-Stall Pop-ups:** At local markets (Stoke, Newcastle), set up a stall with a pull-up banner and a BP machine. Offer free checks to collect leads on a clipboard. Stall rent is often free for health outreach.
*   **Gym-Floor Walk-Rounds:** In branches targeting active men (Wolstanton, Beaconside), have a pharmacist in an "Ask me about Men's MOT" t-shirt chat to members during quieter dayparts and leave locker stickers.

### 3. Owned & Earned Digital ‚Äì ¬£0 Spend
*   **Google Business Profile:** Add each paid service to the "Products" tab and post one Q&A weekly ("Do I need to fast for a cholesterol test?") to capture high-intent searches.
*   **WhatsApp Status:** Each branch phone should post the service-of-the-week poster to its "Status" daily at 08:00. This is seen by every customer waiting for a prescription notification.
*   **Community Facebook Groups:** Have alternating staff members share the flyer JPEG and a booking link on relevant local groups (e.g., "Spotted Cannock") to avoid spam flags.
*   **Nextdoor "Local Deal":** List introductory prices (e.g., ¬£59 Health MOT) for free under the "Local Deals" tab for hyper-local reach.

### 4. Sourcing Social-Proof Without Spend
*   **Google Reviews:** Print a QR code on till receipts that links to the Google Review page with the headline: "‚òÖ Tell us how we did ‚Äì enter our free prize draw". (**Compliance Note:** Must include a link to T&Cs, e.g., "Full T&Cs at bit.ly/cornwellspromo").
*   **User-Generated Content (UGC):** Ask happy travel-jab clients to send a holiday picture and tag the pharmacy (`#CornwellsTravels`) in exchange for a free sample of mosquito repellent.
*   **ASA-Safe Before/After:** Show anonymised, real-world results, such as a printed-out blood pressure chart showing a percentage improvement after a Health MOT. (**Compliance Note:** Mask all personal identifiers, including dates and exact mmHg readings, to be compliant).

### 5. Example Micro-Events Calendar (Staff-Time Cost Only)
| Month | Event (60-min pop-up)                  | Target Branches          | Lead-Magnet Print       |
|-------|----------------------------------------|--------------------------|-------------------------|
| July  | "Sun-safe & travel vax Q&A"            | Newcastle, Wolstanton    | A5 checklist card       |
| Sept  | "Back-to-School Ear-Check demo"        | Chadsmoor                 | Sticker voucher         |
| Oct   | "Flu-fighter Friday" at Tech Park      | Beaconside               | Desk-drop door-hanger   |
| Jan   | "New-Year BP blitz" in WI halls        | Weeping Cross, Holmcroft | Punch-card for review   |

*   **Print Runs:** 50 counter signs per version (150 total), 200 staff cards
*   **Channel/Asset Gap:** Google Ad Local Campaign (call-only, 8 a.m.‚Äì6 p.m.) to capture high-intent searches like "pharmacy near me UTI".

    *   **[OUTPUT TYPE: Text for Graphic Designer]**
    *   **PROMPT:** "Act as a marketing copywriter for a trusted UK pharmacy chain, 'Cornwells Chemists'. Your task is to write copy for an A6 counter-top sign targeting busy, time-poor professionals and students. The sign must present two options for seeing a pharmacist, without devaluing the free NHS service. The goal is to upsell a ¬£25 private appointment based on the benefit of speed and convenience.
        
        **Your output must be a JSON object with three distinct variations for A/B testing, using the keys 'variation_A', 'variation_B', 'variation_C'.**
        
        Each variation should contain a 'headline' and 'body'. The body must clearly present two options:
        1.  **NHS Option:** Expert care, free, seen when a pharmacist is available.
        2.  **Private Option:** 'Pharmacy First Plus', ¬£25, guaranteed appointment slot, no waiting.
        
        -   **Variation A (Benefit-led):** Headline focuses on the value of time.
        -   **Variation B (Direct Offer):** Headline is a clear, direct question.
        -   **Variation C (Problem/Solution):** Headline highlights the problem (waiting) and solution (private slot)."

*   **Target Branches:** Chadsmoor ‚óÜ Abbey Hulton (high young-family density, GP wait frustration)
*   **Print Strategy:** A4 posters + school newsletter inserts + parent flyers
*   **A/B Testing Opportunity:** Test emotional vs. practical messaging:
    - Version A: "Worried about your child? Get peace of mind today"
    - Version B: "Child poorly? Skip the GP wait - see our pharmacist today"
    - Version C: "Same-day appointments for poorly children - ¬£20"
*   **Print Runs:** 20 A4 posters per version per branch, 1000 school newsletter inserts, 500 parent flyers
*   **Channel/Asset Gap:** Fridge-magnet appointment cards with a friendly cartoon design to serve as a tactile, visible reminder for parents.
*   **Collateral:** A4 In-Store Poster + School Newsletter Insert.
*   **Generation Prompts:**
    *   **[OUTPUT TYPE: Image]**
    *   **PROMPT:** "Create a photorealistic image for a poster, in the style of a gentle, candid photograph with a shallow depth of field. The scene is inside a bright, modern UK pharmacy. **Subject:** A female pharmacist (in her 40s, warm expression, wearing a Cornwells Chemists uniform) is kneeling down, listening intently to a young girl (age 5, in a UK-style school uniform) who is pointing to her ear. **Background:** The girl's mother (relatable UK working parent, looking relieved) stands slightly out of focus in the background. **Lighting:** Soft, natural light from a window. **Composition:** Rule of thirds, focusing on the interaction between the pharmacist and child. The mood must be caring, professional, and reassuring."
    *   **[OUTPUT TYPE: Text for Graphic Designer - Poster Version]**
    *   **PROMPT:** "You are a marketing copywriter. Write copy for an A4 poster for Cornwells Chemists, targeting parents in family-dense UK communities like Chadsmoor. The goal is to promote a new ¬£20 'Peace of Mind Pediatric Clinic'. The core pain point to address is the long wait for GP appointments for common childhood illnesses. The tone must be empathetic and solutions-focused.
        
        **Your output must be a JSON object with three distinct variations for A/B testing: 'emotional_hook', 'practical_hook', 'price_hook'.**
        
        Each variation needs a 'headline', 'body_copy' (max 40 words), and a 'call_to_action'.
        
        -   **Emotional Hook:** Focus on alleviating parental worry.
        -   **Practical Hook:** Focus on the problem of GP wait times and the convenience of after-school slots.
        -   **Price Hook:** Lead with the affordable price as the main benefit."

    *   **PROMPT:** "You are a medical information designer. Create the structure and copy for a professional, two-sided A4 'Digestive Health Action Plan' for Cornwells Chemists. The document must look and feel like it's from a private clinic, instilling trust and authority. The target audience is educated patients who self-research online and are frustrated by misinformation. Use a clean, sans-serif font like Inter.
        
        **Output a structured layout plan:**
