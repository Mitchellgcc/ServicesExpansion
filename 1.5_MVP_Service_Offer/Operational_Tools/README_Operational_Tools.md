# Operational Tools - Implementation Guide

## Overview
This directory contains all the **hands-on operational materials** needed to execute the 10 MVP service tests. These are the actual tools staff will use day-to-day during the 1-month pilot phase.

**Critical Principle:** All MVP tools are **paper-based** to eliminate IT dependencies and reduce implementation complexity. Digital integration comes after successful validation.
