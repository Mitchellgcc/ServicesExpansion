# Men's Health: MVP Service Offer

### **Objective**
To test if men are willing to pay a premium for a formal, confidential, and clinicalised service for Erectile Dysfunction (ED), rather than just a simple drug supply, indicating a viable market for a more advanced clinic.

---

### **The MVP: "Men's Confidential MOT"**

*   **Full Vision Reminder:** Dual clinics for ED and Testosterone Replacement Therapy (TRT) with in-depth diagnostics and specialist-led care.
*   **Current State Reminder:** Near-zero revenue. The service exists only as an informal, PGD-based supply of Sildenafil.

### **MVP Implementation**

1.  **Action:**
    *   Formalise the existing PGD-based Sildenafil supply into a **bookable, private service** named the "Men's Confidential MOT".
    *   This reframes the interaction from a transaction to a clinical consultation.

2.  **Process:**
    *   A structured, 10-minute appointment.
    *   **Step 1:** The Healthcare Assistant (HCA) performs a BP check and calculates BMI.
    *   **Step 2:** The pharmacist then runs through the core clinical questionnaire for the Sildenafil PGD.

3.  **The Offer:**
    *   Charge a **Â£15 consultation fee** for the "MOT".
    *   This fee is for the clinical assessment and advice itself.
    *   The patient can then purchase Sildenafil at the standard price if it is deemed clinically appropriate following the MOT.

4.  **Success Metric & Goal:**
    *   **Goal:** To determine if the target market values the clinical assessment and confidentiality enough to pay a fee, which is a key indicator for a future, more comprehensive TRT and Men's Health clinic.
    *   **Metric:** Achieve **15 paid MOT appointments** in one month at a pilot site. This would confirm that men are willing to engage in a clinical service, not just a retail purchase.
