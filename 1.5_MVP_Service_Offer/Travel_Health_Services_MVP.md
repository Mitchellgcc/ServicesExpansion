# Travel Health Services: MVP Service Offer

### **Objective**
To test if a new, product-focused marketing strategy can increase the revenue and visibility of the existing travel vaccination service.

---

### **The MVP: "The Essential Travel Jab Package"**

*   **Full Vision Reminder:** "The Travel Health Concierge" - a premium, end-to-end service including Yellow Fever certification and bespoke travel kits.
*   **Existing Service Status:** Travel vaccinations are already offered and generating revenue, but this is done on an ad-hoc, à la carte basis. This MVP tests a **new marketing and packaging strategy** to drive growth.

### **MVP Implementation**

1.  **Action:**
    *   Market a specific, fixed-price package targeting the most common travel destinations for your demographic (e.g., Summer holidays in Europe, Turkey; backpacking in Thailand).
    *   This requires zero new clinical setup, it is purely a marketing initiative.

2.  **Process:**
    *   Leverage existing Patient Group Directions (PGDs) for **Hepatitis A and Typhoid**.
    *   Create a simple A5 flyer and an in-store poster with a clear, benefit-led headline: **"Holiday-Ready in 15 Minutes: Essential Travel Jabs for £95"**.
    *   Place these marketing materials at the pharmacy counter and in the window of pilot branches.

3.  **The Offer:**
    *   A combined consultation and vaccination service for Hepatitis A & Typhoid for a fixed price of **£95**.
    *   This simplifies the offer for the customer and anchors it to a clear, value-driven price point, moving away from a confusing menu of individual jab prices.
    *   This MVP specifically avoids the need for complex risk assessments for more exotic travel at this stage.

4.  **Success Metric & Goal:**
    *   **Goal:** To determine if a productised, easy-to-understand package can drive new demand and higher revenue per interaction for the existing travel health service.
    *   **Metric:** Sell **20 "Essential Travel Jab Packages"** in the month preceding the peak holiday season (e.g., June). This would show that the marketing-led, packaged approach is more effective at capturing business than the current ad-hoc method.
