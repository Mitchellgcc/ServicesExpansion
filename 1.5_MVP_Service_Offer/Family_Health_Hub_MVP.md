# Family Health Hub: MVP Service Offer

### **Objective**
To test if parents are willing to pay a premium for the convenience and certainty of a pre-booked, private appointment for their child's minor health concerns, even when a free NHS alternative exists.

---

### **The MVP: "The 'Peace of Mind' Pediatric Clinic"**

*   **Full Vision Reminder:** A fully integrated, app-driven, multi-tiered pediatric service hub for families.
*   **Current State Reminder:** £0 revenue, blueprint only. This is a test for a completely new service.

### **MVP Implementation**

1.  **Action:**
    *   Leverage the existing **NHS Pharmacy First service** as the clinical backbone for treating common childhood ailments. The innovation here is purely in the marketing and access model, not the clinical delivery.
    *   This requires no new PGDs or clinical skills.

2.  **Process:**
    *   No new technology is needed.
    *   In two pilot pharmacies, heavily promote "Bookable appointments for your child's health worries" via in-store posters and pharmacist recommendations.
    *   Create a simple paper-based booking diary at the counter to manage the appointments.

3.  **The Offer:**
    *   Offer a private, 15-minute bookable slot with the pharmacist for **£20**.
    *   This service runs in parallel to the free, walk-in NHS Pharmacy First service.
    *   The core value proposition being sold is **convenience**: a guaranteed, uninterrupted consultation time, eliminating potential waits.

4.  **Success Metric & Goal:**
    *   **Goal:** To directly measure the value parents place on convenience for pediatric care.
    *   **Metric:** Secure **10 paid 'Peace of Mind' appointments** per month at a pilot site. This would prove that the convenience model is a strong enough differentiator to build a private service upon.
