# Gut Health & Digestive Wellness: MVP Service Offer

### **Objective**
To de-risk the service by testing if customers will pay for expert assessment and triage *first*, before committing to the higher cost of a full diagnostic test.

---

### **The MVP: "The Tummy Troubles Triage"**

*   **Full Vision Reminder:** A tiered diagnostic and treatment pathway using validated tests (Coeliac, H.Pylori) and dietitian follow-ups.
*   **Current State Reminder:** £0 revenue, blueprint only. A market that is full of misinformation, so an evidence-based approach is key.

### **MVP Implementation**

1.  **Action:**
    *   Offer a pharmacist-led "Digestive Health Assessment" as a standalone consultation.
    *   This positions the pharmacist as the expert triage point.

2.  **Process:**
    *   The pharmacist uses a simplified, two-page paper-based questionnaire based on **Rome IV criteria**.
    *   This allows the pharmacist to screen for red-flag symptoms (e.g., unexplained weight loss, bleeding) and identify key symptom patterns (e.g., bloating, bowel habit changes) in a structured, evidence-based way.

3.  **The Offer:**
    *   A 20-minute consultation for **£45**.
    *   The primary outcome of the consultation is **not** a test, but a printed **"Digestive Health Action Plan"**.
    *   This plan will either:
        *   Provide lifestyle advice (e.g., trial of peppermint oil for IBS symptoms).
        *   OR formally recommend a specific diagnostic test (e.g., "Based on your symptoms, we recommend a Coeliac disease screen").
    *   The diagnostic test itself is a separate, subsequent purchase, which the patient can choose to make.

4.  **Success Metric & Goal:**
    *   **Goal:** To establish the pharmacy as a credible, evidence-based source of advice for gut health and to see if customers value this triage step.
    *   **Metric:** Have **10 patients pay for the Triage consultation** in a month. Of those 10, at least **5 go on to purchase the recommended diagnostic test**. This proves the triage model works and creates a qualified sales funnel.
