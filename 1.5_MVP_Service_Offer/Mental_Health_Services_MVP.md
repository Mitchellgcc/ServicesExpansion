# Mental Health & Wellbeing Services: MVP Service Offer

### **Objective**
To safely and ethically gauge community interest and need for mental health support in a pharmacy setting, without making any clinical claims or offering direct consultation, to inform future service development.

---

### **The MVP: "The Community Wellbeing Point"**

*   **Full Vision Reminder:** A tiered mental health gateway offering structured, pharmacist-led interventions, digital tools, and specialist referral coordination.
*   **Current State Reminder:** Â£0 revenue, blueprint only. This is a highly sensitive clinical area requiring a cautious, non-clinical first step.

### **MVP Implementation**

1.  **Action:**
    *   Create a physical **"Wellbeing Point"** in a discreet corner of two pilot pharmacies. This is an **information-only MVP**.
    *   This is not a "clinic" and should not be branded as such.

2.  **Process:**
    *   Stock the Wellbeing Point with high-quality, free leaflets from trusted national charities like **Mind, the Samaritans, and Anxiety UK**.
    *   Add a simple, pharmacy-branded A5 sheet that clearly lists the contact details for trusted local NHS and charity support services (e.g., the local IAPT service, crisis lines). The pharmacist must verify these contacts are up to date.
    *   No clinical advice is offered. The pharmacy team is trained to respond to queries by saying, "We have some useful, confidential information over here if you'd like to take a look."

3.  **The Offer:**
    *   This is a passive, free, and non-clinical information service.
    *   To actively measure interest, a key component is a simple, GDPR-compliant sign-up sheet with the heading: **"Register your interest for a free, informal group talk on managing stress and improving wellbeing, held here at the pharmacy."**

4.  **Success Metric & Goal:**
    *   **Goal:** To safely understand the level of local need and the community's willingness to engage with the pharmacy on mental health topics.
    *   **Metric:** Gather **15-20 names** on the sign-up sheet for the group talk within one month. This level of proactive interest is a powerful, ethically-sound indicator that a more formal mental health service would be well-received. It validates proceeding to the next stage of service development, which could involve bringing in a third-party specialist for the talk.
