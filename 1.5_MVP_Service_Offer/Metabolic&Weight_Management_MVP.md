# Metabolic & Weight Management: MVP Service Offer

### **Objective**
To create a lean, repeatable model for expanding the already successful weight management service into new pilot sites with minimal initial financial risk, testing local demand before a full-scale rollout.

---

### **The MVP: "GLP-1 Quickstart Consultation"**

*   **Full Vision Reminder:** "The Metabolic Reset Clinic" - a comprehensive, multi-stage program with Mounjaro as the gold standard and deep digital integration.
*   **Existing Service Status:** High-performing service (£37,955/month). This MVP is **not for launching the service**, but for **testing its expansion into new territories**.

### **MVP Implementation for Expansion**

1.  **Action:**
    *   At a new pilot site (e.g., a location with high footfall but currently low private service revenue), dedicate one pharmacist who has completed the core competency training.
    *   Limit the initial service to **Wegovy (semaglutide)** only. This leverages its more established supply chain and lower initial cost price, delaying the higher-cost Mounjaro until the model is proven *at this specific location*.

2.  **Process:**
    *   Utilize a simple, two-page paper-based protocol for the initial assessment and first injection training. This avoids any need for immediate IT system changes at the pilot site.
    *   The protocol will include a patient consent form, baseline clinical measurements (weight, BMI, BP), and a checklist for injection training.

3.  **The Offer:**
    *   A single, upfront fee of **£199**.
    *   This fee includes:
        *   The initial 45-minute consultation.
        *   A full clinical assessment.
        *   The first pen of Wegovy.
    *   This is a self-contained, low-risk entry point for both the patient and the pharmacy to test the waters in a new location.

4.  **Success Metric & Goal:**
    *   **Goal:** Validate that the successful weight management service has patient demand in a new geography, and test the efficiency of the lean, paper-based expansion protocol.
    *   **Metric:** Achieve **5 new patient sign-ups** within the first month at the pilot site. This would confirm local demand and justify investing in the full service (including Mounjaro and IT integration) for that site.
