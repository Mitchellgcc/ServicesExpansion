# Core Vaccinations: MVP Service Offer

### **Objective**
To test the viability of a new B2B sales channel for the existing vaccination service by conducting a direct, sales-led outreach program to local businesses, requiring zero marketing budget.

---

### **The MVP: "The Local Business Flu Jab Service"**

*   **Full Vision Reminder:** A three-pillar model encompassing a private clinic, NHS commissions, and extensive corporate services with formal SLAs.
*   **Existing Service Status:** A successful service with a strong NHS foundation (£5,764/month) and private offerings. This MVP tests the development of a **new corporate (B2B) channel**.

### **MVP Implementation**

1.  **Action:**
    *   Create a simple, one-page A4 PDF outlining a "Workplace Flu Jab" offer. This should be professionally branded but concise.
    *   This is a **sales-led MVP**, not a marketing-led one.

2.  **Process:**
    *   The lead pharmacist or manager at two pilot branches personally visits **5-10 nearby small-to-medium sized businesses** (e.g., solicitors, accountants, estate agents, local council offices).
    *   They will present the one-page offer directly to the office manager or owner. This requires dedicated pharmacist time, not a marketing budget.

3.  **The Offer:**
    *   "We come to you. We offer on-site flu jabs for your entire team."
    *   **Pricing:** A flat fee of **£15 per person**, with a minimum of 10 people per visit.
    *   This provides a clear, easy-to-understand price and a minimum threshold to ensure logistical viability.

4.  **Success Metric & Goal:**
    *   **Goal:** To test the real-world demand for B2B vaccination services and understand the practical challenges and opportunities of delivering care outside the pharmacy.
    *   **Metric:** Sign up **one local business** for an on-site flu vaccination clinic. Securing even a single client through this direct, sales-led approach proves the B2B channel is viable and provides invaluable feedback for scaling up to a larger corporate offering.
