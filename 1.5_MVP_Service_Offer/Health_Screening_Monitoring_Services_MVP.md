# Health Screening & Monitoring: MVP Service Offer

### **Objective**
To test if the existing, high-volume, single-service customers (e.g., for BP checks, ear wax removal) can be converted into customers for a cohesive, private, multi-metric health screening package.

---

### **The MVP: "The 'Know Your Numbers' Campaign"**

*   **Full Vision Reminder:** A tiered Bronze/Silver/Gold "Pharmacy Health MOT" model with CQC diagnostic standards and comprehensive testing.
*   **Existing Service Status:** A top-performing category, but revenue is siloed in specific services like NHS BP Checks (£24,828/month) and Ear Wax Removal (£7,735/month). This MVP tests the **productisation** of these disparate services into a single, private package.

### **MVP Implementation**

1.  **Action:**
    *   Pilot the **Bronze MOT** package. This bundles existing capabilities into a new, marketable product.
    *   Run this as a focused campaign in two pharmacies that already have high footfall for the individual screening services.

2.  **Process:**
    *   Use existing Point-of-Care Testing (POCT) devices for a finger-prick Cholesterol and HbA1c screen.
    *   Use the existing automated blood pressure machine and BMI calculation methods.
    *   The HCA can perform the tests, with the pharmacist delivering the results and providing advice in a structured 10-minute follow-up consultation.

3.  **The Offer:**
    *   Market this as a time-limited campaign, especially to patients already in for a BP check: **"While you're here, why not get the full picture? For just £59, we can add a Cholesterol and Diabetes check to your results."**
    *   This provides a clear upsell path from the existing NHS service.

4.  **Success Metric & Goal:**
    *   **Goal:** To prove that there is a demand for a consolidated, private health check-up, converting single-service users into multi-service customers.
    *   **Metric:** Achieve **15 paid 'Know Your Numbers' checks** during the one-month campaign at a pilot site. This would validate the strategy of bundling existing services into a premium, private package and justify building out the Silver/Gold tiers.
