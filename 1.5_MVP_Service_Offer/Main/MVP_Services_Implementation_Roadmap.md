# Cornwells MVP Services: Complete Implementation Roadmap
## From Marketing Brief to Live Implementation - Step by Step (Fact-Checked v1.3)

---

## ‚ö°Ô∏è **Execution Realism: Critical Notes on Capacity, Tech & Sequencing**
*This section contains critical overrides and notes to ensure the plan is operationally viable.*

### **1. Capacity & Staffing Realism**
-   **Marketing Manager (Est. 30-35h/wk in Weeks 1-2):** To keep the load manageable, the **Marketing Assistant** will take ownership of creating staff-training decks and managing the print-proofing process.
-   **Branch Managers (Est. 5-7h/wk):** To reduce time commitment, core training will be delivered via **30-minute micro-training videos** instead of live sessions where possible.
-   **Print Coordinator (Batching):** To manage workload spikes from A/B test iterations, all non-urgent print runs will be batched into two slots per week **(Tuesday and Thursday)**.

### **2. Data, Tech Stack & Lead Times**
-   **Bitly Free Tier (1,000 clicks/month TOTAL):** This will be exceeded in ~2 weeks. **Action:** Pre-emptively upgrade to a paid plan (¬£25/mo) or deploy an open-source alternative (e.g., YOURLS).
-   **Mailchimp Free Tier (500 contacts / 1k sends):** This will be breached quickly. **Action:** Use the **Sendinblue (Brevo)** free tier (9k sends/mo) or implement a Gmail-based auto-reply system for the pilot phase.
-   **Google Local Services Ads:** This requires a background check and insurance verification. **Action:** Factor in a **5-business-day lead time** before the ads can go live.

### **3. Sequencing & Focus**
-   **Men's Health vs. Health Screening (Wolstanton):** The Men's Health campaign for Wolstanton will be prioritized in Week 2 to ensure the booking page is live for Saturday match-day leaflet drops.
-   **Travel Clinic (Newcastle):** TikTok filming will be pulled forward to **Week 1, Day 4** to capture the peak student gap-year booking window.
-   **GLP-1 Service:** Due to high-risk compliance, this service will have a **soft-launch in Week 5** after initial analytics and processes are well-established.

-   **Monday AM:** Finalize artwork templates for all items and batch-generate serialized QR codes (e.g., `WX-GCARD-01`).
-   **Monday PM:** Print a pilot run of 500 units per asset. Quality check, then pack them with a "Partner Saves ¬£X" note to reinforce value.
-   **Tuesday‚ÄìThursday:** Deliver assets to all partners. Log the acceptance in the central Google Sheet and begin monitoring QR scan data.
-   **Friday:** Conduct the first conversion read-out and place re-order requests for the top-3 performing assets.

-   **Workflow:** Print lab runs 1k units per asset. Each batch has a unique QR code (`Branch-Asset-Version`, e.g., `WX-GCARD-01`) linking to a pre-filtered booking page.
-   **Agreements:** A simple MOU (Memorandum of Understanding) on letterhead confirms Cornwells supplies the useful items for free in exchange for guaranteed distribution by the partner.
-   **Gamification (Golf):** Serial-numbered QR codes on scorecards allow for a monthly leaderboard. Golfers submit their score + BP reading, and the best "stroke/BP ratio" wins a sleeve of balls donated by the pro-shop.
-   **Added Value (Cycling):** The Tyre-Pressure card doubles as a laminated ICE (In Case of Emergency) card for name and allergies, adding significant patient-safety goodwill.

#### **C. Compliance Snapshot**

-   **Landing Pages:** All QR landing pages must carry the mandatory fee/eligibility disclaimer.

- [ ] **Market Stall Pop-ups:** Free health checks with BP machine at local markets

- [ ] **WhatsApp Status:** Daily service-of-the-week poster at 08:00. **Compliance:** Add header "Cornwells Updates ‚Äì reply STOP to mute".
- [ ] **Community Facebook Groups:** Share flyer JPEG with booking links
- [ ] **Nextdoor Local Deals:** List introductory prices for hyper-local reach
