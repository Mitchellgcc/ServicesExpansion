# Cornwells Chemists: Comprehensive MVP Implementation Plan

## **1. Overall Objective & Methodology**
To deploy a series of low-cost, high-feedback Minimum Viable Product (MVP) tests across 10 service categories. The goal is to gather real-world data on customer demand, price sensitivity, and operational feasibility before committing to full-scale investment and rollout. This document outlines the tests, the risks, the resources required, and a detailed action plan for a one-month pilot phase.

## **3. Risk Assessment & Mitigation Plan**

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation Plan |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Low Patient Uptake** | Medium | Medium | The low-cost nature of the MVPs minimizes financial loss. If a service shows no traction, it is paused with minimal sunk cost. Focus marketing on in-store posters and pharmacist interaction first. |
| **Staff Overload/Resistance** | Medium | High | Clearly designate a "Service Champion" at each pilot site. The implementation plan is phased to minimize disruption. Emphasise that these are short-term, one-month tests. |
| **Negative Patient Feedback** | Low | High | Ensure all patient-facing materials are professionally designed and clear. Have a structured script for explaining the new services. Implement a simple feedback form for all MVP participants. |
| **Minor Clinical Incident** | Low | High | All MVPs operate within existing PGDs or provide information only. Pharmacists must adhere strictly to established protocols. Ensure indemnity insurance covers all proposed activities. |
| **IT/Process Failures** | Low | Medium | The plan intentionally relies on paper-based systems (booking diaries, forms) for the initial tests to eliminate IT failure as a risk. Digital integration is part of the full rollout, not the MVP. |
