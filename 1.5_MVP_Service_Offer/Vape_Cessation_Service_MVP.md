# Vape Cessation: MVP Service Offer

### **Objective**
To test if individuals actively seeking to quit vaping are willing to pay an initial fee for a structured, pharmacist-led consultation, validating the demand for a formal, clinical vape cessation programme.

---

### **The MVP: "The Vape-Free Kickstart Consultation"**

*   **Full Vision Reminder:** A multi-session, paid programme including an initial assessment, a 4-week behavioural support package, and a tailored Nicotine Replacement Therapy (NRT) plan.
*   **Current State Reminder:** This is a brand new service with zero revenue. It addresses a modern, growing health concern not covered by traditional smoking cessation services.

### **MVP Implementation**

1.  **Action:**
    *   Create a single, standalone **bookable, private service** named the "Vape-Free Kickstart Consultation".
    *   This frames quitting as a clinical goal requiring expert support, not just willpower.

2.  **Process:**
    *   A structured, 25-minute appointment.
    *   **Step 1:** The pharmacist conducts a detailed vaping history (device, nicotine strength, habits) and assesses nicotine dependence.
    *   **Step 2:** They use Motivational Interviewing techniques to explore the patient's reasons for quitting and set a firm "Quit Date".
    *   **Step 3:** A personalised NRT plan is created, recommending the most suitable product(s) and explaining correct usage.

3.  **The Offer:**
    *   Charge a **Â£30 consultation fee** for the "Kickstart Consultation".
    *   This fee covers the expert assessment, personalised quit plan, and behavioural strategies.
    *   The patient can then purchase the recommended NRT products at the standard price.

4.  **Success Metric & Goal:**
    *   **Goal:** To prove that a market exists for a paid, professional vape cessation service, which is a crucial first step before developing the full multi-session support package.
    *   **Metric:** Achieve **10 paid "Kickstart Consultations"** in one month at a pilot site. This demonstrates a clear willingness to invest in expert help for vape cessation.
